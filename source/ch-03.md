% Chapter 03

And so it begins!
=================

The starting point
------------------

So, you are learning a programming language... you know what this means?

~~~ {.rust}
fn main() {
    println("Hello World!");
}
~~~

Yes, it is that simple. As you can see, functions are declared using the generic `fn` keyword (for the C habituÃ©s, the return type&mdash;if any&mdash;is specified as in ML, after an ASCII arrow e.g. `fn random() -> int { ... }`).

To out your own, save this code snippet and call `rustc`!

Now let's try something funny:

~~~~ {.rust}
fn main() {
    let out = "Hello World!";
    for c in out.chars() {
        /* spawn concurrent tasks! */
        do spawn {
            print!("{}", c);
        }
    }
}
~~~~

The looping point
-----------------

First, notice the loop syntax: for (each) `element` in `container`, as in Python. `element` should be `_` if you are not using it (no referencing).
Here, we make use of Rust's functional paradigm by using `.chars()` to iterate over the chars of our string (it used to be `.iter()`): our iterator will successively host each char of the string, so we can print those directly.
What if we wanted to simply iterate a said number of times? Well, for that we have a special container, the `range()` iterator.

~~~~ {.rust}
for i in range(n) /// Creates an iterator that will do `n` times, from 0 to n-1
for _ in range(1,n+1) /// This one will go from 1 to n
/// Notice the joker `_`, that's if we don't want to reference the iterator for use in the loop
~~~~

Now, before first looking at the type syntax itself, let's look at the output:

~~~~
Hllo World!
e
~~~~

Well, we did `spawn` a few concurrent tasks. Things are done asynchronously, which means that one of the tasks may unpredictibly end-up before the other. Anyways, spawning threads to print out the letters of a sentence is pretty silly!

BTW, speaking of loops: `while` uses the usual syntax: `while <condition> {}` and the `loop` keyword is to be preferred to `while true {}`, which is essentially a hack.
Rust doesn't have the `do {} while;` syntax, we just use a `while` with a condition instead.

Variables and types
-------------------

As you can see, variables are declared via the `let` keyword and you do not need to specify the type (ML anyone?) because Rust has type inference, which means that the variable type is determined automatically at _compile time_ &mdash;not to be confused with dynamic typing, as in Python, where the variable type gets determined at run-time and can be modified.
Let's look at some of the primitive types:

~~~~ {.rust}
let a = 3; // considered as `int` by default
let b = "code"; // that would be an `str` - string
let c = [1, 2, 3]; // and that's a `vec` - array
let d = true; // bool
~~~~

Rust variables are immutable by default in order to avoid some common errors, so you need to append the mutable `mut` keyword to `let` in order to reassign a value. The compiler will warn you if there are unused `mut`s in your code.
BTW: unlike C for example, Rust does not let you edit an immutable variable via its pointer.

Speaking of type assignment, you can force the use of a particular type:

~~~~ {.rust}
let a: uint = 3; // unsigned int
let a = 3u; // same as the last line, this is a short variable suffix for convenience

let mut n = 3; // `n` is supposedly an `int` from here...
n = 5u; // but is assigned an `uint` here, so the compiler will consider `n` as an `uint`
let mut h = ~[]; // unknown-type `vec` - won't compile as such
h = [1u, 2, 3]; // a `vec` of `uint`s
~~~~

There are other suffixes like `i32` (32-bits integer), `i64`, `f32` (32-bit float), `f64`... the empty type is called nil and annotated `()`. But remember, you cannot change the type of a variable during it's lifetime&mdash;static typing!

Functions need explicit parameters and return types. Let's look at one:

~~~~ {.rust}
fn abs(x: int) -> uint {
    if x > 0 { x }
    -x
}

fn square(x: int) -> int {
    x*x
}

fn main() {
    let mut x = 3u;
    /* Now, calculate the square. */
    x = square(x);
    println(x);
}
~~~~

Ok, but this code will warn because we are passing an unsigned int to a function that takes int as parameter; if we were in a situation where we cannot change the type annotation, we would have to just cast the value of `x`. Rust has 2 ways of casting: `x.to_targetType();` and `x as targetType;`. The `to_*` method is to be preferred for performance.
Additionally, there's a third way of casting, [into][cast-ways].

In Rust, instructions that do not end with semicolons are expressions (not statements), meaning that they will return their value to the higher-level block.
This allows you no only to return from a function but&mdash;for example to allocate a value based on a test's result. This is valid Rust code:

~~~~ {.rust}
let hype =
    if cake == "KitKat" {
        10
    } else if cake == "Jelly Bean" {
        7
    } else {
        5
    };
~~~~

A last note on types and prints
--------------------------------

Let's go back on a similar example as with the `spawn`s before, this time using a `vec` of `char`s:

~~~~ {.rust}
fn main() {
    let out = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'];
    for c in out.iter() { // iterate over `out`
        print!("{}", c);
    }
}
~~~~

Strings and pack of char's are essentially the same in memory, but strings have specific methods and are plain better at handling a bunch of `char`s.
FYI, there's a small article that talks about types in Rust and has interesting facts, [check it out][rust-types]!

So Rust has a few printing functions, the standards `print`/`println` which want a `string` as input but also `print!`/`println!` macros (or syntax-entensions&mdash;ending with `!`) which will format-print your variables marked as `{}` and passed as arguments into strings.
BTW, you can [specify the type manually][fmt-types], e.g. `{:u}` says this is an unsigned integer literal.


Appendix: Going back on macros
------------------------------

About the macros: they are syntax extensions in the sense that they are like scripts, but are evaluated at compile-time. So they serve only the developer by simplifying/automating things.
Think about `#define` in C, but much more powerful. BTW, macros have a few syntax elements of their own, for example, variables get referenced as `$var`.

Not elaborating further on it for now but you can have a look at the [mainline macro tutorial] for some code examples.

Appendix: Code comments
-----------------------

You will probably start quickly adding comments to your code (well, you should anyways!) so let's speak about that now.
Rust uses C-style comments: inline with `// yuck!` and multiline with `/* yuck! */`. Rust also has a built-in doc generator (librustdoc); doc comments get referenced as such with either `///` or `/** **/`; check out how it works for the [standard library]!

You can learn more about rustdoc [here][rustdoc].

Appendix: on functional programming
-----------------------------------

The functional capatibilities of Rust are powerful as it makes use of type-specific operations.

~~~~ {.rust}
let my_vec = [-1, 0, 1];
for i in my_vec.iter().invert() {
    print(i.to_str());
}
