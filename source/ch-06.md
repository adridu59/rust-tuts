Getting some pointers
=====================

Rust is quite particular when it comes to pointers: it keeps a high-performance
scheme while ensuring safety use patterns (no dangling pointers, etc.).

We will also talk about *ownership* and *lifetimes* in this chapter.

Introduction
------------

First, let's look for a second at how things are laid out in memory. There are
two important [memory pools], the **stack** and the **heap**.

### Simply put

Functions are individual, reusable pieces of code. If we want to directly edit a
variable from the originating (caller) namespace, we need to pass its memory
address, i.e. a pointer to the said variable so that the function knows where to
find it and access it.  

<small>Also, when passing huge structures of data you might want to pass a
pointer to it to save on memory copies but that is a quite sparse use-case as we
will see.</small>

### On stack, and heap

Each application uses a pool of memory called the **stack**, of fixed-size,
allocated when a task starts up. There are various mechanisms occuring inside
the stack but it is mostly hosting all *local variables* and parameters used
along the execution. When a function is called, the existing registers are saved
on memory and the program jumps to the function and creates a new stack frame
for it. The stack also traces the order in which functions are called so that
function returns occur correctly. The default stack size of a Rust task is 2
MiB.  
So, we need to pass a memory address in order to be able to edit a variable from
the caller's namespace&mdash;that is the main reason why we use pointers.

A program can also dynamically request memory with the unused memory in the
computer, managed by the OS: this is called the **heap**. All dynamically-sized
types (DST) are stored on the heap with an OS allocation.  
The heap can only be accessed via a pointer located on the stack since it is not
the default memory pool, these pointers create a **box**.

So, an `int` has a fixed-size in memory and is stack-allocated. A dynamic-array
`~[]`, a string `~str` or anything `~` is allocated on the heap (that is where
you would use `malloc` in C or `new` in C++).

Give me pointers
----------------

Rust has two primary pointer types: the borrowed reference (using the `&`
symbol) and the owned pointer (indicated by `~`).

### Referencing

Referencing is also called borrowing because creating a reference freezes the
target variable, i.e. it cannot be freed nor transfered (so no use-after-free).
When the reference gets out of scope and freed, it is available again to the
caller.
References use the `&` operator, just like C pointers; or `&mut` with
mutability, which need to point to uniquely referenced, mutable
data&mdash;everything is statically checked.

This would be the most basic example:

~~~~rust
let x = 3;
{
    y = &x; // `x` is now frozen and cannot be modified
    // ...but it can be read since the borrow is immutable
}
// `x` can be accessed again (`y` is out of scope)
~~~~

A borrow cannot outlive the variable it originates from: it has a **lifetime**,
meaning that you will have to change your allocation pattern if a reference
outlives its lifetime, like here:

~~~~rust
let mut x = &3;
{
    let mut y = 4;
    x = &y;
} // `y` is freed here, but `x` still lives...
~~~~

This pattern will be rejected, since `y` has a shorter lifetime than `x`.  
The compiler enforces valid references and yields:

~~~~bash
error: borrowed value does not live long enough
~~~~

**Note:** there are a few cases through like when returning a reference passed
to a function where you will need to add a lifetime annotation, so that it is
inferred from the caller; more on that a bit later.

Referencing is the default choice as a pointer: all checks are performed at
compile-time (by the borrow checker) so its footprint is that of a C pointer
(which is also available in Rust as `unsafe`, `*` pointer).  
The unary star operator `*` also serves for dereferencing, like in C.

### Unique ownership

An owned pointer owns a certain (dynamically allocated) part of the heap, i.e.
the owner is the only one who can access the data&mdash;unless it transfers
ownership, at which point the compiler will free the memory automatically
(pointer is copied, but not the value).

~~~~rust
fn take<T>(ptr: ~T) { // works for any type, `T`
    ...
}

let m = ~"Hello!";
take(m);
take_again(m); // ERROR: `m` is moved
~~~~

Note that owned pointers can, like most objects, be borrowed. You can also
copy a unique pointer using `.clone()`, but this is an expensive operation.

### Shared pointers

"Shared" may evoke Garbage Collection to you. Well, this is partly the case.

Using only owned and borrowed pointers, ownership forms a [DAG], while shared
pointers allow multiple pointers to the same object and cycles. There are few of
them, either GC-managed (with immutability to prevent data races), or Reference
counted with specific types that allow thread-sharing or mutability, for
instance. Note that Rust also has, of course, mutable shared pointer types.

**Note:** As you can see, these pointers serve a particular purpose. You should
not have to look at them until they are needed in one of your programs.

First and foremost, please note that the new tracing, task-local Garbage
Collection algorithm that will be introduced into the standard library is being
worked on right now.  
So, there used to be an `@` managed pointer type, but it has been phased out in
favor of `std::rc::Rc` and `std::gc::Gc`; which are standard library types.
Right now, `Gc` is just a wrapper around `Rc`, which manually counts references,
meaning less overhead than a GC algorithm (which periodically checks for pointer
references) but it has a few limitations, e.g. it will leak memory on cycles
(recursive data structures and the likes).

**Note:** task-local (or per-thread) GC is an important part of the deal because
it means that you can have a task which handles low-latency jobs and is manually
managed and another that can just run GC; task local also means that you can't
pass these pointers between tasks, which can be desired in some cases.
