Guess what...
=============

Okay, now let's do some lab work. You should (almost) have the knowledge to implement a classic litle game: guessing a secret number.

> The computer (randomly) chooses a number between 1 and 100 and the user must find it; the computer will tell whether the given number is too low/high until the user finds the right one.

Alright, let's have some prerequisities beforehand.

The first thing we will need is to have a random number in our hands.

Getting some RNG
----------------

We want an integer random number, bounded between 1 and 100. Let's print a few of them:

~~~~ {.rust}
// `use` imports methods into namespace
use std::rand::{task_rng, Rng};

fn main() {
    let mut cur;
    for _ in range(0, 11) {
        // nb: range upper bound is exclusive
        cur = task_rng().gen_range(1, 101);
        println!("{}", cur);
    }
}
~~~~

Then, we will have to get input from the user. Unlike `print` and friends, input methods are not built in Rust programs by default, ie. they are not in the prelude.

Importing from the standard library
-----------------------------------

So, we will have to import the relevant `std::io` methods manually, with the `use` keyword that is just like `import` in Python or Java. `#include` in C is quite similar too althrough C works only on a per-file basis.
Contrariwise, Rust uses the concept of module. Similarly to Java's packages, each file is a module, but not only: you can declare modules with the `mod` keyword within a file, and each one has a different namespace, which means that you will have to go through logical paths (`::`) of modules when importing methods.

Module names are lowercase by convention.

**Note:** modules are superseded by `crate`s, which are individual compilation units (one gets compiled at a time, e.g., one library on a project makes one crate).

~~~~ {.rust}
// We can select different functions with `{}`.
// Note: `use` must precede `mod` statement.
use foo::{bar, baz};

mod foo {
    pub fn bar();
    pub fn baz();
}

bar();
baz();

// Now, import `baz()` fn from `bonus.rs`.
mod bonus;
bonus::baz();
~~~~

**Note:** the `priv` and `pub` attributes permit to allow/disallow access to a specific module of function.

So, back to the stdio things:

~~~~ {.rust}
use std::io::stdin;
~~~~

If you are looking for a specific function to import at some point, just look in [libstd documentation] or [ask your way on IRC][IRC].

**Note:** if you wanted to import from external libraries you would have to link to them using `extern mod`. For example, the Rust filestack has an `extra` library for non-core things, which you could link to using `extern mod extra;` before your `use` statement.

Calling the user... err?
------------------------

Alright, now let's call `read_line()` to get input from the user. This method makes use of the `Option` type we just saw.

~~~~ {.rust}
use std::io::buffered::BufferedReader;
use std::io::stdin;

fn main() {
    println!("Type something:");

    let mut reader = BufferedReader::new(stdin());

    // Note: input will end with `\n`
    match reader.read_line() {
        // Handle empty input too
        Some(~"\n") => println!("\nI never asked for this..."),
        Some(thing) => println!("\nYou typed: {}", thing),
        None        => println!("\nWell, that's unexpected!")
    }
}
~~~~

On a side note: if you want a message and an input on the same line, it will take a direct access to `stdout`.

~~~~ {.rust}
use std::io::stdout;

stdout.write("Type something: ".as_bytes());
println!(reader.read_line().unwrap());
~~~~

Now we want to get an int out of `stdin`, but looking at the empty case, the program could behave strangely depending on what we are doing with it. So instead we could ask the user back for input (by a recursive call to our input function, for example) or stop with a specific error message.
Here is an example that uses a `loop`:

~~~~ {.rust}
use std::io::stdin;
use std::num;

fn number_input() {
    let mut ret;
    println!("Please type a number: ");

    loop {
        // We need to trim the EOL `\n` char to be able to convert
        match from_str::<int>(stdin().read_line().trim_right_chars(&'\n')) {
            Some(x) => {
                ret = num::abs(x).to_uint().unwrap();
                break;
            }
            None => {
                println!("Yea, well... better with a number.");
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~~

Okay, that should be all you need. Just do it by yourself and the compiler outputs first before looking at the doc!

Let's add something to the game: we will count how many times the user tries and display it at the end.

The Solution (well, an implementation of it)
--------------------------------------------

So here it is:

~~~~ {.rust}
use std::io::buffered::BufferedReader;
use std::io::stdin;
use std::num;
use std::rand::{task_rng, Rng};

fn input_line() -> ~str {
    let mut reader = BufferedReader::new(stdin());
    loop {
        match reader.read_line() {
            Some(~"\n") => println!("\nUhm, please type something..."),
            Some(thing) => { return thing },
            None => continue
        }
    }
}

fn input_number() -> uint {
    let mut ret;
    println!("Please type a number: ");

    loop {
        // it is important to allocate here for lifetime; cf. following chapter!
        let input = input_line();
        match from_str::<int>(input.trim_right_chars(&'\n')) {
            Some(x) => {
                ret = num::abs(x).to_uint().unwrap();
                break;
            }
            None => {
                println!("Yea, well... better with a number.");
            }
        }
    }
    ret
}

fn main() {
    println!("The computer is choosing a secret number, between 1 and 100...");
    let nbr = task_rng().gen_range(1u, 101);
    let mut cpt = 0u;

    println!("Can you guess it?");
    loop {
        cpt += 1;
        match input_number() {
            x if x < nbr => println!("Too low!"),
            x if x > nbr => println!("Too high!"),
            _ => { println!("Yes, you found it in {} tries!", cpt); break; }
        }
    }
}
~~~~

We have `input_line()` that takes a non-empty stdin input and `input_number()` that ensures a non-empty converted number.
