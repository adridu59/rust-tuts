Few things you should know
==========================

The Rust API is frequently evolving (read: improving), so this tutorial will be aimed at current master which has the latest language contents.
Note that most of the "standard" features are pretty much stabilized and should not change much. You can choose to use the latest release, but as it gets older, there will probably be numerous changes onto the latest trunk. If you have any concern related to the language or its syntax, just [jump on IRC][IRC] and ask the others!

The latest release is Rust 0.9, released on January 9th 2014.

Installing Rust
---------------

### Windows

You can get [snapshot builds][snapshots-windows] for Windows through the NuGet [Package Manager console]:

~~~~bash
Install-Package Rust
~~~~

Or have a look at the [build instructions][build-windows] if you want to build it yourself.
**Note:** `mingw-w64` should fix a few things compared to the regular `mingw` (it works on both 32- and 64-bit systems, despite the name).

If you are not willing to go through these steps, just download the [0.9 release][win-release].

### Mac OS X

The installation process on Mac OS is fairly easy using the [Homebrew package manager][Homebrew]; for the latest trunk, run:

~~~~bash
brew install --HEAD rust
~~~~

And to get the latest release:

~~~~bash
brew install rust
~~~~

### Linux

Okay Linux users, let's build the beast:

~~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/rust.git
cd rust
./configure
make
sudo make install
~~~~

And for the 0.8 release, use these sources:

~~~~bash
curl -O http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.9.tar.gz
tar -xzf rust-0.9.tar.gz
cd rust-0.9
./configure
make
sudo make install
~~~~

Note that there are repositories with nightly packages for [Arch], [Fedora] and [Ubuntu].

Get your code editor ready
--------------------------

You are about to write your first Rust program; just create a `.rs` file with your favorite text editor. It gets built with `rustc`, the Rust compiler.

~~~~bash
# create a new file
touch hello.rs
# now compile it...
rustc hello.rs
# ...and run!
./hello
~~~~

Using the `-O` switch will add the default optimization level to the code.

BTW, you can get syntax highlighting for [vim], [gedit] or [other highlighting solutions] on the main repo.
