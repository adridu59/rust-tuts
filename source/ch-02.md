Few things you should know
==========================

The Rust API is frequently evolving. While the use of the 0.8 release is recommended on Windows (unless you're willing to [build it][build-windows]), this tutorial will be aimed at current master which has the latest language contents.
Note that much of the "standard" features are pretty much stabilized and shouldn't change much. If you have any concern related to the language or its syntax, just [jump on IRC][IRC] and ask the others!

Installing Rust
===============

Windows
-------

Checkout the [building instructions][build-windows].
Note: `mingw-w64` support is incoming on latest trunk.

If you're not willing to go through these steps, just download the [0.8 installer][win-installer].

Mac OS X
--------

The installation process on Mac OS is fairly easy with the [Homebrew package manager][Homebrew], for the latest trunk:

~~~~ {.bash}
brew install --HEAD rust
~~~~

And to get the latest release:

~~~~ {.bash}
brew install rust
~~~~

Linux
-----

Okay Linux users, let's build the beast:

~~~~ {.bash}
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/rust.git
cd rust
./configure
make
sudo make install
~~~~

And for the 0.8 release, use these sources:

~~~~ {.bash}
curl -O http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.8.tar.gz
tar -xzf rust-0.8.tar.gz
cd rust-0.8
./configure
make
sudo make install
~~~~

Note that there are repositories with nightly packages for [Arch] and [Ubuntu].
